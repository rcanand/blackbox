# Blackbox Classic Board Game

The Blackbox board game is a classic board game, where players guess the presence of hidden atoms in a grid by shooting probes from the sides. See [link on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_(game))  for rules and how to play.

This variant is a command line ruby game, that provides the same game in an interactive command line interface. It is entirely built in ruby. 

## How to play

Your machine needs to have a recent version of ruby installed (ideally 2.2 and beyond, but earlier versions may also work).

Just make the blackbox file (path below) executable, and execute it:

```
> project_folder/rb/blackbox/bin/blackbox
```

Launch the game, and follow the instructions to configure and play the game.
